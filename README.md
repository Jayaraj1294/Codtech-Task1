## Overview of the Project

### Project: Password Strength Checker

### Objective
This project aims to give users visible feedback regarding the strength, length, and complexity of the passwords they have typed. gives you an indication of how secure your passwords are. 

### Design Goals
1. Provide visual feedback to the user regarding the strength of their password.
2. The feedback has to be instantaneous. This means no clicking on a button to test the strength.
3. The trigger event can be any of the keyboard events. I've chosen keyup since this is the most appropriate for our specific need.
4. For the visual feedback, I've chosen to change the background colors to draw the user's attention to this.
5. Provide additional quantifiable feedback so the user knows in which departments the password lacks strength and how it can be 
   improved.
